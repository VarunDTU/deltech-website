          <p className="text-xs leading-relaxed sm:text-lg">
            The flagship event of IEEE India Council, IEEE AISYWLC has always
            been a colloquium that brings together youth with professionals and
            experts with their ideologies tallying up to be the best exchange of
            wisdom and acuity. Founded in 2000, the AISYWLC has grown over the
            years to become the biggest event on the calendar for IEEE members
            in India. It is a conglomeration of inventors, professionals,
            entrepreneurs, visionaries and some of the greatest minds in the
            country. By bringing together amazing people from all walks of life,
            the AISYWLC empowers its participants to be inspired, collaborate
            and innovate for tomorrow.

            This year we will be conducting exciting events on latest
            technologies for students coming from different engineering
            backgrounds. This will help them connect to leaders and eminent
            speakers of their respective streams. We will also be catering to
            the needs of young professionals and senior members by having a
            platform for them to share their professional articles and views and
            help them get articulated to the crowd attending these symposiums.
            We also have some events in store for the women in engineering, a
            celebratory and an inspirational session for the women who've made
            it successfully and created benchmarks that we all look up to.
