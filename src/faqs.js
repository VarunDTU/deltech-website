            The flagship event of XYZ India Council, XYZ DELTECH-MUN has always
            been a colloquium that brings together youth with professionals and

            This year we will be conducting exciting events on latest
            technologies for students coming from different engineering
            backgrounds. This will help them connect to leaders and eminent
            speakers of their respective streams. We will also be catering to
            the needs of young professionals and senior members by having a
            platform for them to share their professional articles and views and
            help them get articulated to the crowd attending these symposiums.
            We also have some events in store for the women in engineering, a
            celebratory and an inspirational session for the women who've made
            it successfully and created benchmarks that we all look up to.
